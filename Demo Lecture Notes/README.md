This is not a series of actual, game-used lecture notes. This is just an experiment in what it would look like to write lectures notes in a Jupyter notebook. 

How readable or unobtrusive is the code? Ideally, the code would be so readable and short that someone could teach online, coding/plotting in real time instead of drawing by hand and using a tablet or document camera. For static lecture notes, the code could be hidden with an appropriate extension or one could write to a LaTeX document as I do in the example in the LaTeX folder.
